# Expression Tree

This project was completed as my IB Computer Science HL internal assessment during my senior year of high school. The project was completed over a period of nearly four months, spanning from mid-October of 2020 to early January of 2021.

The program itself creates an expression tree that converts expressions from prefix to infix notation and accurately evaluates them.

The program is written entirely in C++. Some of the fundamental concepts of programming that are implemented in the program inlclude pointers, switch case, try and catch errors, object-oriented programming (classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, etc), and more. For a more detailed explanation of the utilization of such concepts in the program, you can read my [internal assessment] (); the paper will also reveal my creative process in completing this program.
